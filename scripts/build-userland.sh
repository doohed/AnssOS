# userland/rust/ (see docs/rust.md): the interactive programs (sh, play,
# scarf, tile) and the small self-test payloads (hello, crash,
# malloctest, ...) that prove the ring-3 pipeline end to end. Drops their
# built ELF binaries where kernel/src/exec/blobs.rs expects to find them
# (include_bytes!) so they get embedded directly into the kernel image --
# see kmain (kernel/src/main.rs) for how they land in /bin at boot.
#
# This is a genuinely separate build (its own toolchain flags, its own
# linker script) from the kernel itself -- these are ring-3 userland
# programs, not kernel code -- run before `make -C kernel` since the
# kernel embeds its output.

# needs telling that it's building bare-metal x86_64; gcc gets nothing
