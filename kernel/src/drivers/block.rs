//! sectors (512 or 4096 bytes).
//!
//! Writes are locked: write() refuses unless the kernel was booted with
//! `allow-disk-writes` on its command line (limine.conf `cmdline:`), which
//! only test configurations pass. The live USB image never does, so
//! nothing it runs can change a disk. virtio-blk, QEMU's own disk image
//! (AnssOS-disk.img), isn't registered here and isn't affected.
