//! A unidirectional in-kernel byte ring -- the transport under pipe() and
//! use_as_stdio(). Deliberately non-blocking only: the tick only preempts
//! *ring-3* code, never ring 0, so a busy-spin inside a syscall waiting on
//! another process would never yield the CPU to that process -- a real
//! deadlock, not a style issue. Every operation here returns at once;
//! callers that want blocking semantics loop in their own ring-3 code
//! (safely preemptible), as anssos's read_key() does.
